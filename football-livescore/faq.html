    - Consider to subscribe to your favourited teams first, before subscribe to the whole leagues.<br />
    - You can also subscribe at the match level however we do not recommend this as you will need to manual unsubscribe it after the match completed <br />
    - We also provide you the option to turn off notifications while still retain all configurations.
